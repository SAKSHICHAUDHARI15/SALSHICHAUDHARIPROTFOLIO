  <h1>Numb</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    The haunting thoughts staring at me from so close, it won't hurt yet,<br>
    They have started to eat me.<br>
    Quarter, half and full.<br><br>

    The whispering vices frogged my body more<br>
    Numb, now<br>
    Frozen move<br><br>

    Anxiety found the realm inside me<br>
    It stayed, for a while,<br>
    For a while, and then so long,<br>
    It never left.<br>
    My subconscious isn't as kind.<br><br>

    Darkness in the room, dark rose up as my heart hardened<br>
    Begging please.<br>
    Words flowing out of my lips.<br>
    The verse, the whisper, it's a curse.<br><br>

    Maybe my demons, they heard my berceuse<br>
    My demons waiting at the herse<br>
    Words become poisonous, and the haunting stares at me,<br><br>

    They have almost eaten me<br>
    I'm shedding tears, kissing away my pain<br>
    I catch glimpses of shattering my heart already into pieces,<br>
    the eternity quivering within me.<br><br>

    I call into eternal slumber, I fall through mirrors, I drown, I sank<br>
    I collapse, over and over again,<br>
    It held me, become numb<br>
    Embarked into darkness widely<br>
    My thoughts almost finished me.<br><br>

    I keep scrubbing at stains.<br>
    Me, my book my pen, filled with thoughts.<br>
    A heartbreak.<br>
    Set me on a fire at stake....<br>
