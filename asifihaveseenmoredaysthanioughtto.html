  <h1>Numb</h1>

  <div class="poem">
Someday uncertainty death would knock on my door, as if it crawled the way past me,  
I be trying to put my feelings into words,  
The page full of ink stains, my fingerprint clasped and ink stinks.  

my finger getting numb and stiff as if I have seen the way I'm going to die  
As if I have seen more days, than I ought to.  

Grief / pain / sorrow / misery / agony knocks my door again.  
And I knew this time it is going to stay for so long, ever.  
I'm still sitting in bed, leaving the page staining blue and spilling into whoever it meets.  

As if I have seen more days, than I ought to  
This time it walks into the blanket, vacant, slow.  
Afraid of keeping it more, it gently whispers my ears, a melody / a lullaby and so promising.  
As if I knew it's going to say for so long, ever.  

Scared, impatient, I lock up myself, and walled it up.  
The darkness strikes my chest, the stained page, haunts me, blue,  
midnight blue, dark blue, black, numb  
I ran, and ran till I found light, white light so bright.  

Afraid of keeping it more, scared, crying, wailing, trembling,  
like a baby, in my pajamas, open hairs, puffed eyes, carving  
and cold, my heartache.  
It left me as a hole yet whole  
A silent echo whisper melody.  

As if I have seen more days, than I ought to  
It was nothing but my own engrave / throes crying, belonging to, my shadow  
But someday uncertainty death would knock my door.
