      <p>
        Once back then, love was Symphony a sweet lullaby/serenade,<br>
        That I fell so deeply and wholly in farce.<br>
        He was not the king who stole my heart,<br>
        Plus destiny chose to always tear us apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh! The heartbreak, her heartbreak<br>
        So devastating a look, yet her love stayed alive in every room.<br>
        His smile, like sunshine on skin,<br>
        But fate brutal, already set path did unwind.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked down the room, felt like aisle<br>
        In grey shirt and jeans, leaving my soul all shatter,<br>
        he left my happiness drowned.<br>
        And love, it is a brutal twist but a closure.
      </p>

      <p>
        He left, yet her eyes filled with love,<br>
        So pure like, reflected soul to his smile,<br>
        So cold and obscure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak<br>
        Always on the way to visit like a haunting ghost in his all moves,<br>
        Her mind hopeless, already thoughts made up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving is coward, unable to feel is whole love.<br>
        A tape, a tale of love, loss, regret<br>
        A gentle reminder, the choices he made cannot be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as he stands gracefully with shattered heart plea,<br>
        Play he is in search of solace far away from me.
