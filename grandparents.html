  <h1>Grandparents</h1>

  <div class="poem">
In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
My heart found a grief to hold on.  

In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
My reminiscences miss the space we shared back then.  

In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
They just filled the hollow gap between two hearts and collided.  

In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
It's the real pain that held me up, you to leave me alone.  

In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
Nothing terrifies me more than they fled,  
And now their voice only echoes in bed.  

In English we say I love my grandparents  
In poetry we say,  
I feel relief the moment they are aside,  
Cuz the moment ain't repetitive.
